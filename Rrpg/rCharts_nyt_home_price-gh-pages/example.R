#this example plots two data sources in the NYT format
#1. the original Shiller 20 home price indices
#2. managers dataset included with R package performance analytics

#The cumulative growth transformation/formula is
#most commonly seen in time series from 
#finance, business, and economics.  There
#are various other potential applications.
#Here is one interesting
#use of cumulative growth http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2909426/.
#Exponential growth series demonstrated in network analysis,
#biochemistry, agriculture could also work in this context.
