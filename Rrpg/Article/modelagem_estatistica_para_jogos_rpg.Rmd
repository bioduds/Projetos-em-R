## Introduction

As an RPG (Role Playing Game) ex-player and data scientist, it occurred to me to try and perform statistical experiments, in order to learn possible methods that are more suited to be used in RPGs for predicting outcomes of actions and events.

### Random Variables

Frequently, ...

## Binomial Distribution versus Simple Dice Rolling
